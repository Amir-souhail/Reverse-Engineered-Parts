# Gearbox Housing Cover Plate (Exercise 257)  

This project contains the **reverse-engineered 3D CAD model and 2D drawing** of the *Gearbox Housing Cover Plate* from **SolidWorks Exercise 257**.  
The original reference was a **2D technical drawing** (see source image in this folder), which I used to regenerate both:  

- The **3D model** in **SOLIDWORKS 2025**.  
- A matching **2D engineering drawing** from the model.

## üìå Reference Drawing  
The part was reverse-engineered from the provided 2D drawing with parameters:  

- **A = 12 mm**  
- **B = 20 mm**  
- **C = 16 mm**  
- **D = 80 mm**  
- **E = 30 mm**  
- **F = 1.5 mm**  
- **G = 3 mm**  
- **T = 1 mm**  

The expected volume of the model: **8473.79 mm¬≥**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used  
- **SOLIDWORKS 2025** ‚Äì Part modeling & drawing recreation  
- **STEP/IGES Export** ‚Äì For interoperability  
- **Technical Drawing Reference** ‚Äì Source blueprint image

## üìñ Workflow  
1. Interpreted dimensions and geometric relationships from the reference drawing.  
2. Created the **3D solid model** in SOLIDWORKS 2025.  
3. Regenerated the **2D drawing** directly from the 3D model for validation.  
4. Verified volume and geometry against the reference values.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Role in Assembly  

This part functions as a **gearbox cover plate with shaft support**.  

- The **central hole (√ò20 mm)** allows a **shaft** to pass through.  
- The **raised central hub** provides rigidity and can hold a **bearing** to support the shaft.  
- The **four mounting holes (√ò9 mm)** are for **bolting the plate** to the gearbox housing.  
- The **ribbed design** increases strength and stiffness while minimizing material usage.  

**In practice:**  
- The plate is **bolted onto the gearbox housing** to close one side.  
- A **bearing** may be fitted in the hub to guide and support the rotating shaft.  
- The shaft extends through the cover plate, transmitting torque to external components such as pulleys, gears, or couplings.  

This makes the part both a **protective cover** and a **structural support** element in the gearbox assembly.

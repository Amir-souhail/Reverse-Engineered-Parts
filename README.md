Got it! You want the **bullet points and content to be centered** along with the gallery. In GitHub Markdown, we can use HTML `<div align="center">` around each section to center everything. Here‚Äôs the corrected version of your README with the bullet points properly centered:

# Reverse-Engineered Projects & Parts

This repository contains my collection of **reverse-engineered parts and projects** created in **SOLIDWORKS**.
Each project starts from a **2D technical drawing sourced online**, which I then use to:

<ul>
<li>Recreate an accurate <b>3D CAD model</b>.</li>
<li>Regenerate the <b>2D engineering drawing</b> based on my 3D model.</li>
<li>(When applicable) Build complete <b>assemblies</b>.</li>
</ul>

---

## üìå Purpose

<ul>
<li>Strengthen my skills in <b>3D CAD modeling</b> and <b>technical drawing recreation</b>.</li>
<li>Develop a personal library of <b>reverse-engineered components and assemblies</b>.</li>
<li>Practice generating <b>engineering drawings</b> from models.</li>
<li>Document my workflow and methodology as part of my learning journey.</li>
</ul>

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Software

<ul>
<li><b>SOLIDWORKS</b> ‚Äì For part, assembly, and drawing creation.</li>
<li><b>STEP/IGES Exports</b> ‚Äì For compatibility and sharing.</li>
<li><b>Technical Drawings (sourced online)</b> ‚Äì Used as references for reconstruction.</li>
</ul>

---

## üìñ Workflow

<ol>
<li>Collect <b>2D drawings</b> from publicly available references.</li>
<li>Recreate the <b>3D CAD model</b> in SOLIDWORKS.</li>
<li><b>Regenerate the 2D drawing</b> from the 3D model, matching the original as closely as possible.</li>
<li>Export parts, assemblies, and drawings in <b>neutral CAD formats</b> for sharing.</li>
<li>Document assumptions, sources, and challenges for each project.</li>
</ol>

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

<ul>
<li>All models and drawings are created <b>for educational and practice purposes only</b>.</li>
<li>Source drawings are taken from freely available references on the internet.</li>
<li>No proprietary or confidential designs are included.</li>
</ul>

---

## üöÄ Future Scope

<ul>
<li>Expand with more <b>mechanical parts, assemblies, and detailed drawings</b>.</li>
<li>Organize projects by <b>categories and complexity</b>.</li>
<li>Explore reverse engineering from <b>real-world references (photos, videos, or measurements)</b> in addition to 2D drawings.</li>
</ul>

If you want, I can **also make the gallery display multiple images side by side**, so it looks like a neat showcase grid instead of one below the other. This is very visually appealing for GitHub repos. Do you want me to do that?

# 3D Visualization Project: Metal Components (FB6H, FB4H, UA7H, UA3H, UA2H8)

This project contains the **reverse-engineered 3D models and visualizations** of five single-piece sheet-metal parts defined in **Metal Component Specifications.pdf**.  
The goal was to create accurate **3D CAD geometry, visualizations, and fabrication-ready drawings** for presentation and portfolio purposes.

## üìå Project Description

The project involved rebuilding **five small sheet-metal components** from a given specification.  
Each part was modeled in **SOLIDWORKS 2025** with accurate thickness (2 mm), hole placements (√ò5 mm & √ò7 mm), corner radii (3 mm), and bends.  
The output includes both **3D models** and **2D CAD drawings** suitable for **laser cutting and folding**.  
This work demonstrates the ability to convert technical specifications into **manufacturable CAD data** and **professional visualization outputs**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Workflow

1. Interpreted the **2D specifications** from the provided PDF.  
2. Created parametric **SOLIDWORKS models** for each part.  
3. Applied **materials, appearances, and lighting** for visualization.  
4. Generated **2D flat patterns (DXF)** for laser cutting and folding.  
5. Exported in multiple formats for CAD sharing, rendering, and manufacturing use.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes on Design Challenges

- The original PDF did not specify **sheet-metal K-factor** or bend allowances.  
  ‚Üí Default industry standards were applied.  
- Some dimensions required **interpretation/assumptions** to resolve overlaps.  
- Hole sizes and corner radii were unified based on the general notes in the specification.

## üè∑Ô∏è Ownership & Attribution

- The original geometry was defined in **Metal Component Specifications.pdf**.  
- Models and visualizations were created **solely for portfolio, learning, and presentation purposes**.  
- No commercial use or redistribution of the original design is intended.
